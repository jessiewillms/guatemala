		<h4 id="q1">Q: Which members of Congress are criticizing the National Security Agency?</h4>

		<p>Criticism of the NSA has been a bipartisan affair. On the Democratic side, the leading critics have been Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO). They’ve worked closely with Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul. In September 2013 the three senators co-sponsored legislation that would place strict new limits on the agency’s spying powers.</p>

		<p>In the House of Representatives, Patriot Act author James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) has become a leading critic of the Obama administration’s spying programs along with Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI). In July 2013, Amash offered an amendment to an intelligence funding bill that would have shut down the NSA’s phone records program. It was defeated, but the surprisingly close 205-217 vote was widely seen as a rebuke to the Obama administration.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the most ambitious proposal to limit the NSA was introduced by Rep. Rush Holt (D-NJ). The Surveillance State Repeal Act he introduced in August 2013 would repeal both the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act, the legal foundations of the NSA’s post-9/11 spying programs.</p>

		<h4 id="q2">Q: Who are the NSA’s main congressional supporters?</h4>

		<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), who lead the intelligence committees in their respective houses of Congress, have emerged as the NSA’s most ardent defenders in Congress. They have received the support of congressional leaders from both parties and in both houses of Congress. For example, when Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) proposed an amendment to defund the NSA’s program to collect Americans’ calling records, it was opposed by both Speaker John Boehner, a Republican and the House’s top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi.</p>

		<h4 id="q3">Q: Why didn’t Snowden raise concerns inside the NSA rather than leaking to the media?</h4>

		<p>Snowden says he raised concerns with at least 10 government officials before he made the decision to leak secret documents to the press. "No one at NSA could ever recall an instance where an official complaint had resulted in an unlawful program being ended," Snowden wrote in a statement to members of the European Parliament. "But there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form."</p>

		<p>The NSA said in December that "After extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention."</p>

		<h4>Q: If Snowden believes his actions were justified, why doesn't he come home to stand trial?</h4>

		<p>Some of Ed Snowden’s critics have faulted Snowden for fleeing the country. But Snowden’s defenders say that Snowden wouldn’t receive a fair trial in the United States.</p>

		<p>That’s because Snowden would likely be barred from telling a jury that his disclosures were in the public interest. In other recent prosecutions of whistleblowers, judges have ruled this kind of argument inadmissible.</p>

		<p>The prosecution of Chelsea Manning, who released classified documents to Wikileaks in 2010, is instructive. The Freedom of the Press Foundation writes that "Manning's defense wanted to argue she intended to inform the public, that the military was afflicted with a deep and unnecessary addiction to overclassification, and that the government’s own internal assessments showed she caused no real damage to US interests." But the judge didn’t allow these arguments to be introduced until the sentencing phase of the trial.</p>

		<p>Hence, if Snowden returned to the United States to stand trial, the trial would focus on whether Snowden leaked classified documents — which he has already admitted to doing. He might not have an opportunity to explain to a jury why he believed those disclosures were justified.</p>
