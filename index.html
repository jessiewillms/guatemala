			<h3>A mine that haunts its neighbors</h3>
			<p>EL ESTOR, GUATEMALA - One night this past April, while pouring over legal documents at around four in the morning, Manuel Xo Cu drifted into sleep and had the dream that would save his life.</p>

			<p>The dream involved him grabbing onto the roots of two trees to keep from sliding into a dark hole. On a bus ride the next day, he was confronted by three armed men who asked him to move to the back of the bus. He refused, recognizing it as the dark hole, and sat beside a woman who he would later use as an excuse to get off at an earlier stop, thinking the would-be assassins could identify him with more certainty if he were to get off at his regular destination.</p>

			<p>"I thought, ah, the woman is the root of the trees," said Cu, standing in the book-lined office of the Defensoria Q'echi, a local indigenous rights organization where Cu works as a lawyer and political organizer, on a humid afternoon in July.</p>

			<p>Cu's fear of being murdered, in a setting that could easily by explained as a botched armed robbery, is tragically common in this part of eastern Guatemala. The site of one of the first genocides in the three-decade long armed conflict that scars this country still, the region surrounding Lake Izabal is frighteningly unsafe for those who live at the bottom, even as it enters into a new economic era with the grand reopening of a massive nickel mine and smelting complex on the lake’s north coast.</p>

			<p>“We are scared about what has happened before,” said Irma Yolanda Choc Cac, a resident of a town that near the mine currently embroiled in a violent disagreement with its owners over the scope of its land concession.</p>

			<p>That community, Lote 9, has gone all the way to the Constitutional Court in Guatemala City after it discovered its title to the land was ripped out of a municipal registry. Its land disputes with the mine continues while a World Bank-sponsored surveying project, which could certify some of the indigenous villages’ claim to land ownership, has gone silent despite initially promising to release new maps of the area in January.</p>

			<p>Canada has played a role in the Izabal Department’s long story of lawlessness and land disputes. It was the nickel giant INCO that first won approval from the military dictatorship to open a mine here in 1968, and it was a Canadian mining firm, Hudbay Minerals Inc., that had first seriously attempted to reopen the Fenix project in the mid-2000s after it lay dormant for over twenty years.</p>

			<p>During Hudbay’s brief ownership stint, the mine’s security staff are alleged to have gone overboard in a forced eviction of one of the towns behind the mine by burning down the villagers’ straw homes. The period of terror continued in 2009 when security forces allegedly murdered an anti-mine opponent, injured and paralyzed another with a gunshot wound, and gang-raped 11 women.</p>

			<p>The murders, assaults and rapes are now part of a class action lawsuit to be heard later this year in a Toronto courthouse, litigation that brings with it the potential to set a new precedent in the legal liabilities of multinational Canadian firms working overseas as well as the potency to shatter the federal government’s strategy for handling alleged criminal acts by mining and oil and gas firms overseas.</p>
